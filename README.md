This will be our playground for all things webdev and related technologies. 

The whole idea here is to create a web based stripped down Point of Sale System with, at the very least, the following features

1. User Authentication
2. Product Management
3. Sales Management
4. Inventory Tracking
5. Reports and Analytics
6. Basic Error Handling

Some of these features can be grouped into the same category or can be left as is to help keep the project "modular". May have to have separate trees for each one to that end.
