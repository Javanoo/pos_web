# summary
## pos_web
This was created to be a playground for all things webdev and related technologies,<br> primary focusing on structured programming and php. 

The whole idea here is to create a web based stripped down Point of Sale System with, at the very least, the following features

1. User Authentication
2. Product Management
3. Sales Management
4. Inventory Tracking
5. Reports and Analytics
6. Basic Error Handling

Some of these features can be grouped into the same category or can be left as is to help keep the project "modular". May have to have separate trees for each one to that end.

# update
## Beta 0.0.1
As of now the application is available in beta versiob, very buggy and <br> user-feedback is required for improvements and the so-to-come bug fixes.
None the less, give it a try and tell us what you think.
This beta version only has one module of the two required modules, the sales module.
but soon the administrator module will be added to allow admin manage the app conveniently, as for now,
use phpMyAdmin to administer the back-end, e.g. adding new products, removing and the likes.


## Installation & Try-Out
Note: this app has been or is being tested with php version 8.0, using firefox run on a linux.
1. Install xampp
2. import the provided pos_wed.sql file (the database in use).
3. use "tester" with "1234" for credentials.
4. and thats all.
